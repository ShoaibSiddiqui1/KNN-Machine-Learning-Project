This makes it a binary classification problem, and since the data already includes the correct answers (labels), it is a supervised learning problem.\n",

These include things like a person’s age, work class, education level, marital status, job type, race, gender, hours worked per week, and country of origin. Some of the specific features I plan to use are: age, workclass, education, education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex_selfID, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, and native-country.
